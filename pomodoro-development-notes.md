## Overview

This session established the foundational structure for the toolshed project, creating a comprehensive TOOLS_GUIDE.md based on Simon Willison's proven patterns, and building the first experimental tool: a clean pomodoro timer with subtle UI transitions.

---

## Part 1: Understanding Simon Willison's Tools Repository

### Initial Request
Russell asked about structuring the codebase to learn about working with coding agents, taking inspiration from Simon Willison's tools repository. The goal was to create a TOOLS_GUIDE.md that defines intent and style for all experiments going forward.

### Research Process
We examined Simon Willison's tools repository structure at https://github.com/simonw/tools to understand:
- Organization patterns for 200+ static HTML/JavaScript utilities
- File naming conventions (paired .html and .docs.md files)
- Testing infrastructure (Playwright + pytest)
- Build automation and GitHub Pages deployment
- Common architectural patterns (simple stateless tools, API-connected tools, WebAssembly tools)
- UI/UX standards and responsive design practices

### Key Insights
Simon's approach provides:
- **Lightweight structure**: Single-file HTML tools with minimal dependencies
- **Systematic methodology**: Proven patterns for different tool types
- **Mobile-first design**: Responsive layouts with semantic breakpoints
- **Testing framework**: Automated testing for reliability
- **Auto-deployment**: GitHub Actions for seamless deployment

## Part 2: Creating TOOLS_GUIDE.md

### Planning Phase
Russell decided to follow Simon's detailed technical approach as a foundation while adding their own experimental and humorous personality. The guide needed to be adapted for toolshed's simpler starting point but leverage Simon's proven systematic methodology.

### Guide Structure
Created a comprehensive TOOLS_GUIDE.md covering 18 sections:

1. **Philosophy & Intent** - Experimental, systematic, playful, agent-friendly approach
2. **Repository Structure** - Simplified version of Simon's layout
3. **Tool File Naming Convention** - HTML files + .docs.md documentation
4. **Documentation Templates** - Brief descriptions and optional postmortems
5. **HTML Structure Patterns** - Simple tools and API-connected tools with code examples
6. **Data Loading Patterns** - URL hash, file input/drag-drop, clipboard, API calls
7. **UI Component Patterns** - Copy buttons, loading states, error messages
8. **Responsive Design Standards** - Mobile-first, CSS Grid, breakpoints, clamp() for typography
9. **External Libraries & CDN Loading** - jsDelivr, cdnjs, unpkg recommendations
10. **Development Workflow with Claude Code** - Tool request templates and branch naming
11. **Testing Structure** - Framework for future pytest/Playwright setup
12. **Build & Deployment** - GitHub Pages + GitHub Actions workflow
13. **Documentation & Postmortems** - Learning-focused approach
14. **Checklist for New Tools** - Step-by-step development checklist
15. **Key File References** - Complexity levels and examples
16. **Quick Start** - 10-step guide for first tool
17. **Philosophy Reminders** - Core principles
18. **Claude Code Setup (Local)** - Instructions for local .claude/instructions.md configuration

### Key Design Decision: Local Configuration
Discussed whether `.claude/instructions.md` should be committed to the repo. Concluded that:
- **Best practice**: Keep `.claude/` local only (add to .gitignore)
- **Rationale**: Personal IDE/agent configuration shouldn't pollute repo history
- **Alternative**: Document setup in TOOLS_GUIDE.md for future collaborators
- **Result**: Created `.gitignore` file and added Section 18 to guide

## Part 3: Building the Pomodoro Timer

### Planning
Created a focused plan for a simple but elegant pomodoro timer:

**Features:**
- 25-minute work timer (red) + 5-minute break timer (green)
- Automatic mode switching when timer completes
- Subtle visual transitions and pulse animation during active sessions
- Session counter tracking completed pomodoros
- Keyboard shortcuts: Space (start/pause), R (reset), M (switch mode)
- Auto-start next session when timer completes
- Sound notification using Web Audio API
- Mobile-responsive design

**Design Philosophy:**
- Clean, centered layout
- Large, readable timer display (monospace font)
- Minimal button set
- Color coding (red for work, green for breaks)
- Subtle animations (box-shadow, scale, pulse, text-shadow)
- Mobile-first responsive approach

### Implementation Details

**HTML Structure:**
- Single 442-line self-contained file
- Responsive container with gradient backgrounds
- Large timer display using `clamp()` for fluid typography
- Mode label and session counter
- Control buttons (Start, Pause, Reset, Switch Mode)
- Keyboard hint at bottom

**CSS Transitions:**
- Smooth color transitions on mode change
- Pulse animation during active timer
- Text shadow glow effect (red for work, green for breaks)
- Box-shadow enhancement during active state
- Scale transform on active (1.02x)
- Button hover effects with transform

**JavaScript Logic:**
- State management for mode (work/break), time remaining, running status
- 25-minute work duration, 5-minute break duration
- Real-time countdown with interval updates
- Auto-advance to next session when timer completes
- Manual mode toggle capability
- Keyboard event listeners for shortcuts
- Web Audio API for notification beep with fallback

**UI/UX Features:**
- Button state management (show Start OR Pause, never both)
- Time formatting as MM:SS with leading zeros
- Error prevention for invalid input
- Graceful audio fallback if Web Audio API unavailable
- Mobile-optimized touch targets and font sizes

### File Deliverables
Created three files:
1. **pomodoro.html** (442 lines) - Full tool implementation
2. **pomodoro.docs.md** - Brief documentation and features list
3. **Updated index.html** - Added pomodoro link to landing page

---

## Part 4: Version Control & PR Preparation

### Git Workflow
1. Created feature branch: `feature/pomodoro-timer`
2. First commit: Added pomodoro timer tool
   - 3 files changed, 473 insertions
   - Files: pomodoro.html, pomodoro.docs.md, index.html
3. Second commit: Added .gitignore and TOOLS_GUIDE.md documentation
   - 2 files changed, 898 insertions
   - Files: .gitignore, TOOLS_GUIDE.md

### Commits Made

## Part 5: Key Decisions & Learnings

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Single HTML file**: Keeps tool self-contained and deployable without build steps
2. **Vanilla JavaScript**: No frameworks, simple to understand and maintain
3. **Web Audio API for notifications**: Better UX than console logs, with graceful fallback
4. **Automatic mode advancement**: More ergonomic workflow (don't need to click between sessions)
5. **Keyboard shortcuts**: Essential for pomodoro productivity workflow

### Design Decisions
1. **Monospace timer display**: More stable/readable with tabular-nums
2. **Subtle animations**: Pulse and glow effects provide feedback without distraction
3. **Color transitions**: Red (work) and green (break) match pomodoro conventions
4. **Mobile-first responsive**: Works well on phones, enhances on larger screens
5. **Large tap targets**: Buttons designed for touch on mobile devices

### Process Decisions
1. **Committed .gitignore early**: Prevents config files from being tracked
2. **Added TOOLS_GUIDE.md documentation in same PR**: Explains patterns and philosophy
3. **Feature branch for both tools and docs**: Keeps related changes together
4. **Clear commit messages**: Documents why changes matter
