# Deployment Notes

## Landing Page Creation

Created a basic HTML landing page inspired by `tools.simonwillison.net` with the following features:

- Clean, minimalist design with system fonts
- Responsive layout (max-width: 800px, mobile-friendly)
- Simple tool listing structure with titles, links, and descriptions
- Semantic HTML with minimal CSS
- Blue link colors (#0066cc) and subtle borders

### Files Created

- `index.html` - Main landing page
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment

## GitHub Pages Deployment

### Deployment Process

1. Created landing page and GitHub Actions workflow
2. Committed and pushed to feature branch `claude/create-landing-page-011CUKaWFdFEPyGvjJGEZQzH`
3. Merged PR #1 to main branch
4. Initial workflow run failed (GitHub Pages not enabled)
5. Enabled GitHub Pages in repository settings:
   - Settings → Pages → Source: "GitHub Actions"
6. Re-ran the failed workflow job from Actions tab
7. Deployment succeeded

### Important Note

**GitHub Pages must be enabled before the first workflow run**, otherwise the deployment will fail. If you encounter this:
- Go to Settings → Pages
- Set Source to "GitHub Actions"
- Re-run the failed workflow from the Actions tab

### Live Site

The site is deployed at: `https://rpasetes.github.io/toolshed/`

### Auto-Deployment

The workflow automatically deploys to GitHub Pages on every push to the `main` branch.
